Bootstrap Project

The website is focused on sharing information about the best beaches in the world,
where users can find important details about the services offered by resorts,
such as free Wi-Fi, wellness facilities, entertainment, multiple restaurants, etc.
Additionally, users will be able to discover the top 5 best beaches in 2024.
Purpose: Create a user-friendly website that shows how amazing and unforgettable your vacation will be if you choose the right beach and resort.
The first thing the user will see is the Bootstrap hero section on the Home Page. I decided to place it at the beginning because a large image generates more visual impact,
and a title and a brief description were placed inside the photo. On the services page, a photo was placed in the header, followed by 4 Bootstrap columns containing an icon,
a title, and a brief description. On the gallery page, a Bootstrap carousel was placed with three photos, followed by a title and five cards containing an image, title,
description, and a “Read More” button. The contact form contains the necessary fields for the user to fill out with their information; the Bootstrap form was used.
Finally, in the footer three icons (Facebook, Instagram and TikTok) were placed above a text.
I found it quite challenging to adjust the size of the carousel. I couldn't modify it because making it responsive was difficult, so I ended up leaving it at its original size.
It took me a while to make changes to some of the Bootstrap classes because a <div> could have more than two classes, which was a bit confusing at first.
